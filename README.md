# Personality 2 Big 5 

WhatYouListen_WhoYouAre is a Python application 
that analyzes Spotify playlist data to generate 
personality descriptions based on the Big Five 
personality traits. The model assigns scores for 
Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, 
Agreeableness, and Stability, which are derived from 
a correlation table developed from a study conducted by Anderson et al. (2021).
